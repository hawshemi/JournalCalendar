## Description
**Journal** is a web application with a productivity focus that aids users in creating and organizing their journal entries. It gives individuals a platform to keep a journal of their ideas and experiences, which boosts their productivity and promotes personal development.

This web application was developed  as a [final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/final/capstone/) for [CS50's Web Programming course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) using Django Web Framework, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

Because of the following components, my final product passes the distinctiveness and complexity requirements:


1. As a productivity tool, this project is primarily focused on "Productivity". Users are given a dedicated platform to organize and chronicle their everyday experiences, thoughts, and ideas, which boosts productivity and well-being.
2. To encourage users to continue journaling without missing a day, the Journal App has a dynamic, interactive activity board that functions like a calendar. Users can easily browse through dates on the board and examine their journal entries for particular days.
3. Instead of using a simple text field for the content of submissions, this project uses a rich text editor that allows users to format their entries using features like bold and italic text. This improves the writing process and lets individuals express themselves better when journaling.
4. A feature of the Journal App determines and shows the user's longest run of continuous journaling days. This feature was created from the ground up to encourage users to keep up a regular journaling routine.
5. Users of the app can filter their diary entries by month and year using a feature in the app. This enables people to reflect on their prior experiences and generate new insights.
6. Journal App uses the activity board's animations to enhance the user experience and make it more visually appealing.
